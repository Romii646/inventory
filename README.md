# Main Inventory System

The Main Inventory System is a web-based application for technical staff and administrators to track, manage, and report on IT and lab assets. These assets include composite PC setups, peripherals (keyboards, mice, monitors), components (GPUs, RAM, motherboards, power supplies, etc.), storage devices, and employee/user accounts. The system enforces referential integrity, employee roles, and provides summary analytics via reporting views.
